# Apache-Kafka
 Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that enables the building of real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It provides a publish-subscribe model for processing streams of records in a fault-tolerant and scalable manner. Kafka is often used in scenarios such as log aggregation, event sourcing, and real-time analytics.
